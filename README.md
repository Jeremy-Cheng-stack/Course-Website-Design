# Course Website Re-designed

This is the final project built for my class Introduction to Databases and Web Applications at UofT
Built with Flask, HTML, CSS, SQLAlchemy, SQLite

Make sure you have flask installed with python3

To start off, make sure the version of all our requirements are on the same level:

Some required software to install:

```
$ pip install flask-bcrypt
$ pip install Flask-Session
$ pip install -U Flask-SQLAlchemy
```

Input these commands into the terminal when in the project file to set required software versions the same.

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
